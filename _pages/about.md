# About me

I obtained my PhD from the University of Toronto, supervised by [Amir-massoud Farahmand](https://academic.sologen.net/) and [Rich Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php). 

**Research Goal:** My research combines both theoretical and empirical approaches to robustness and generalization in deep learning, with the goal of enabling more reliable AI systems. I currently focus on the safety and security of LLMs, advancing research that drives practical solutions for responsible AI deployment.

Refer to [Research](https://averyma.github.io/research/) and [Publications](https://averyma.github.io/publications/) for more information on my research, and to [CV](https://averyma.github.io/files/cv_github.pdf) for more information about my academic background.

<!-- Prior to coming to UofT, I studied at the University of Waterloo, where I completed my BASc. in Mechatronics Engineering, and MASc. in Systems Design Engineering. During Masters, I worked at the Vision and Image Processing ([VIP](https://uwaterloo.ca/vision-image-processing-lab/)) Lab, supervised by [Prof. Alex Wong](http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~a28wong/index.html) and [Prof. David Clausi](https://uwaterloo.ca/vision-image-processing-lab/people-profiles/david-clausi).-->

Apr 2018: My Master's research work on 3D reconstruction technologies was featured on [CTV News](https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=1359802).


My primary research interests are in machine learning and its application to computer vision. In particular, I am interested in the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks.

I am working on my MASc. with [Prof. Alex Wong](http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~a28wong/index.html) and [Prof. David Clausi](https://uwaterloo.ca/vision-image-processing-lab/people-profiles/david-clausi) in the Vision and Image Processing ([VIP](https://uwaterloo.ca/vision-image-processing-lab/)) Lab within [Systems Design Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). In Spring 2016, I completed my BASc. in [Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/) at the University of Waterloo.

During the first year of my MASc., I worked as a research engineer intern with [Christie Digital](https://www.christiedigital.com/en-us), a Canadian projector technology company. There I collaborated with a team of Christie engineers on achieving [projector super-resolution enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-resolution_imaging) - extending the resolution of projectors beyond their hardware capabilities.

My Masterâ€™s thesis focuses on 3D reconstruction technologies. I am building a novel active depth sensing system that infers depth by analyzing the blurriness of the projection pattern at different depth levels caused by camera defocus. Without relying on complex hardware, I developed a computational depth inference model based on parametric estimation approach([Gaussian based](http://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/vsl/article/view/96)) and non-parametric estimation ([Deep learning-driven](http://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/vsl/article/view/165)). -->
